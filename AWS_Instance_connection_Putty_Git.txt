3. Choose Load. By default, PuTTYgen displays only files with the extension .ppk. To locate your .pem file, select the option to display files of all types.
4.Select your .pem file for the key pair that you specified when you launched your instance, and then choose Open. Choose OK to dismiss the confirmation dialog box.
